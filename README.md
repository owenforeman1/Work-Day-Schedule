# Work-Day-Schedule

## Description
I wanted to build a regular work day 9-5 planner that has dynamic coloring for past present and future hours. You can input text into each block and save it so you can close it and reopen it later in the day. There is a date on the top of the page which updates daily. If you need a daily work planner that is adaptive day to day this is exactly what you need.
